- Today received the corals from Hawaii (Ariana). Carefully unpacked the cooler of layered wet paper towels.  
    - Pocillopora fragments were on top and despite the paper towel still being damp the corals looked and felt very dry which was slightly concerning  
    - Hot glue gunned all the fragments to number labeled plugs (to help the glue solidify quicker I would dunk them in water).  
    - At this point the tanks had been bleached, the sand that used tot be in them were all scooped out, and had been receiving flow through for the last two days.  
        - All tanks were equipped with a small fully submersible 25C heater (only one setting and 25C is the highest it goes), a blower, two airstones, and a light rig that spanned across two tanks (so each rack was position to be just under that half of the light set up).  
     - Montipora fragments were found towards the bottom and looked equally as dry but much more pigmented than the Pocillopora.  
        - MCAP were glued and put into Tanks 13 and 14 (ten each – twenty total per species)  
        - Pacuta were glued and put into Tanks 11 and 12 (ten each “”)  
    - Once all the fragments were glued and carefully placed into the tanks, the last thing to unpack were the spat plugs which arrived in 50mL Falcon tubes in seawater. *All fragments came from individual colonies so they are regarded as individual genotypes!*
        - These were unpacked and equally distributed to each tank by species (MCAP never put in with P. acuta and vice versa – to avoid death bomb that P. acuta is so infamously known for).  
            - All falcon tubes came with information on species, plug number and age of the spat. However, only half way through did I realize that it would maybe be a good idea to get this information written down so only half of the ages were recorded. 
    - Once all the fragments and spat were unpacked, initial measurements were taken  
        - Temperature using a probe (degrees C), Salinity (ppt) using an aquarium hydrometer, and light intensity (PAR).  
            - Light Intensity was measured across the racks in three different positions to see if there were any noticeable changes in light intensity.  
                - At first light was taken with the glass tops on (light was above the glass shinning into tank) but later had them taken again without the tops because they were a little more opaque than I wanted.  
                - PAR sensor also may be broken – only reading in the mid 50’s and when I tested it with the Ocean Revive Lights (same lights I had in the May-July 2019 Hawaii work – See Holobiont light levels) the PAR sensor was reading about 230 with CH1 and CH2 at 20% (same settings as field work) but 100 units lower.
