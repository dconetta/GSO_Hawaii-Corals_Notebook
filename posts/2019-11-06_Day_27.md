**Coral status:** Great!  
**Tank status:** Ok (see notes)  
**Reservior status:** almost 90 gal

**Actions**  
- Added sodium thiosulfate to reservior
- Checked on corals

**Notes**  
- Corals look really good!
    - Tank 14 corals produce so much waste!
- Tank 12 needs to be squeegeed and 11 is a little cloudy
