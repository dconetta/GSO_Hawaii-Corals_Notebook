**Actions**

**Notes**
- Flow in all tanks was still low despite replaced drippers and Tanks are cleaner than expected (flushed inflow)
- Tank 13 corals still bleached and starting to die
- Tank 12 corals look good
- In Tank 11 - 3 corals that were suffering from tissue loss disease are completely dead. 1 has bits that are still alive. The 3 with early stages of infection seem stable and healthy
