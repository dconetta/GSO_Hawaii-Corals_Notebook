- Immediately checked tanks to see that Tank 12’s dripper had fallen off and was free flowing (fully opened).  
    - Reservoir was ALSO overflowing with some pooling happening in the basement  
        - Immediately shut off the free flowing and all the drippers and flushed the reservoir since it was the only thing to do and was already bleached beforehand.  
        - Emailed Ed Baker about it and he said that it wasn’t a big deal and that it will evaporate – no mops near by  
- The direct impact of free flowing water on high – Tank 12 was so clear and Tank 14 and 11 were still cloudy…stagnant water  
    - Decided to put in a second pump in each tank (the first one is in the back right bottom corner of each tank and the second one was put on the same wall on the near side at mid water column)  
        - I can immediately see the water movement improving and seeing the exchange  
    - Also Tank 12 was so much colder (almost 2 ½ degree C).  
- Re-cut blue tubing to replace the dripper in Tank 12 and got it to work  
- Made sure to put on the flow half way instead of having it fully on – might be why the Tank 12 popped off?  
- Checked on the Tanks at the end of the day too and only 6-7 Gallons of reservoir were collected throughout the 8 hours of running it.

Checked on tanks again, 10/2/19, and the reservoir was ~58 Gallons and the drippers were still on
