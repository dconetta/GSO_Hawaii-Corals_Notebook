**Coral status:** Good  
**Tank status:** Good   
**Reservior status:** 60 gal

**Actions**  
- Added Sodium thiosulfate to res
- Checked on corals

**Notes**  
- transpanted corals seems to be in stable condition
- Tank 11 coral may need to be clipped
- Drippers are at the right flow rate
    - Replaced drippers may have had salt build-up
        - Read in help forums that salt blackage is a common problem with drippers even in fresh water systems
        - Will have to keep an eye on flow and either find a way to clear blockage or replace drippers as needed
        - Forums say many people replace their drippers ~1x/week
