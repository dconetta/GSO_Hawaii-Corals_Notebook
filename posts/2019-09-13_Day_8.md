- MCAP corals look happy and stable. The coral frags in Tank 13 (MCAP) to the left in the front row has a small white patch on the tip of its branch. This patch looks too small to easily clip off  
- Pacuta corals seem to be stabilizing  
- Many polyps are out, and they seem in better condition than Tuesday.  
    - Many/most still have small white patches in the middle of their branches, but they seem to be slowly recovering  
    - Tank 11 seems to be recovering slower than 12  
- See measurements in google/excel sheet  
- Clipped a tiny piece off of MCAP coral in the back-right corner tank 13. Put clipped portion in bleach (10% solution/bath).  
- 5 Gallon water change from each tank
