- Today Erin and I did a water change and check-in the on the corals  
- Mcap corals seem happy and stable  
- Pacuta corals remain in mediocre to poor condition – they have a few white spots in the middle but the ends of the branches look great so it is difficult clip/prune them
- 5 Gallon water changes for all four tanks  
    - Tank 14 somehow accumulates the most algae  
- Pictures taken today and uploaded to google drive
