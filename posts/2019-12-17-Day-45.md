**Coral status:** Moderate  
**Tank status:** Moderate  
**Reservior status:** 25 gal

**Actions**  
- Tank maintenance
- Added 1 gal of bleach to tank 13 (~2.5%) to disinfect 
- Daily measurements
- Cipped frags

**Notes**  
- HP suggests form now on wiping plastic plugs and hot glue with ethanol weekly to prevent infection
- All tanks were about 1/2° cooler than usual, salinity was higher, and reservior level was MUCH lower than expected for the flow rate. Maybe the power went off temporarily?

**Frags clipped**
