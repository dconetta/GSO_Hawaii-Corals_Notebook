**Coral status:** Tanks 11 Moderate, Tank 12 Great!, Tank 13 Poor  
**Tank status:** Moderate  
**Reservior status:** 50 gal

**Notes**  
- Corals in tank 11 look diseased. Same 3 that have been giving me trouble the past few weeks (2062, 2863, 1709)
- Corals in tank 13 are still bleached, including spat. I cannot tell if they are the same or worse compared to the 28th
