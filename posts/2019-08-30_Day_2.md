- Today came in and looked for planulae in tanks since it was the new moon and there was a slight possibility that they were going to spawn.  
    - Didn’t see any spawning  
- Tubing we received today is very large but with the new siphons I was able to get rid of the remaining bits of sand in the tanks. Also did a 5-gallon water change.  
- Turn water on to refill the tanks after purging the system for 5 gallons (one bucket) of water.  
- Corals look a lot better than yesterday!  
    - MCAP still looks a little skeletal (dry) but overall a lot less retracted.  
    - P acuta you can see the polyps out, but a couple of fragments show signs of tissue sloughing  
    - Spat plugs of both species look great! Polyps have been visible since receiving them!  
- See Measurements for today in excel/google sheet  
    - All light measurements taken with PAR Sensor at the same depth as the racks, directly under the light set up (three taken per tank along the horizontal rack).  
    - Created Plug Maps for each of the Tanks (See “Maps” Tab)
