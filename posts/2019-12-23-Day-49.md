**Notes**  
- Some tissue wasting in tank 11 clipped corals
- Tank 12 corals look great!
- Tank 14 disease is advanceing in some front rack corals but back rack seems stable
- Followed Cassie Raker instructions for iodine treatment:
    - Let infected/stressed corals soak in slighly yellow iodine bath with tank from their tank for 10 min. Did this for all tank 14 frags and for the racks to disinfect prior to moving them to tank 13
- Clipped frags from tank 14: 1606, 1534, 2014 (moved to new plug 2184)
