**Reservoir status:** 40 gal

**Tank/Coral status:**  
|ID|Tank status|Coral status|
|--|---|---|
|13|Good|Poor|
|12|Good|Good|
|11|Good|Ok|

**Actions**  
- Switched out drippers and flushed tnak inflow
    - Flow much improved
- Measurements
- Cleand salt off lights

**Notes**
- Res was only 40 gal since flushed on Friday when it should've been closer to 80
    - Tank 11 flow very low and a tank little cloudy probably due to low flow
- Tank 11 corals may still be infected
    - There are white areas near the bases of the plugs and 1 branch is peeling at the base, but this could also be a reaction from the hot glue gun during clipping
    - Tank 13 corals, those that were improving are stable/continuing to improve, some I think are too far damaged to recover and are continuing to decline in health/die
