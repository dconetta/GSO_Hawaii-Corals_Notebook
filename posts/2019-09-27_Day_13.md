- Using the blue tubing and the drippers I made the new low flow system  
    - Put tubing over the black end and put it onto the inflow nozzle. Works great and can remove if need be to flush lines!  
    - The red/orange tip of the drippers faced out produced ½ Gallon per hr drip rate  
- Started by emptying the reservoir and flushing 5 Gallons from the line  
- Then cut pieces of tubing around the drippers so could get system up and running  
- In the meantime, took measurements  
- Tanks all look cloudy and I am not sure why (TURNS out it is water stagnation).  
- All light measurements low because sunset setting begun when started taking measurements  
- Drippers left on over the weekend
