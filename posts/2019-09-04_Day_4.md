- Today did another water change/check on the corals  
- Upon further inspection plug 2070 in Tank 14 looks mostly dead minus one small spot that may hang on.  
    - Decided to cut the live part off and re-glue it to the plug  
    - Bleached the rest of the skeleton in 10% solution  
        - Removed the skeleton left in the 10% bleach solution from 20190903 and left in blue bucket to dry fully  
- Took measurements (see excel/google sheet) and then proceeded with water change (5 Gallons for each tank)  
- Decided to prune any clearly dead portions from the corals. All dead portions were placed in the 10% bleach solution overnight.  
- Photos of each tank taken and uploaded to google drive
