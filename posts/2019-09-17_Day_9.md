- Tank 13 Looks a little cloudy  
- Brought 6 Gallons of bleach for the holding tank/effluent  
- Temp probe today is still dead, needs batteries to be replaced  - MCAP look very happy, very brown and the plugs still look very clean from the last time we cleaned them (20190910).  
- Pacuta look better and seem to be hanging in/reclaiming previously bleached/white spots. Dead patches seemed to cease spreading.  
- Flushed 1x 5 Gallon bucket before letting all tank run while getting measurements. Then cleaned tanks/water change  
- Tube worms growing especially bad in Tank 14
