**Coral status:** Good  
**Tank status:** Moderate  
**Reservior status:** 70 gal

**Actions**  
- Added sodium thiosulfate to reservior
- Daily measurements
- Replaced drippers (wiht old drippers that had been soaked in DI)

**Notes**  
- Tanks could use a cleaning
- 11 is still cloudy but 12 and 14 are clear
- Found out Outlet 4 (power to tank 14) was off because temp in Tank 14 was 2°C colder than usual. I spoke with Ed and he told me there were electrical issues on Thanksgiving (yesterday) that may have caused the fuse to go out. All is back on now. If issue happens again Ed showed me the fuse boxes and in an emergency we can reroute with long blue extension cord. When trying to fix the problem all of the outlets mysteriously turned off. We got everything running again and had to reprogram the lights.
- The corals all look happy despite the colder temperature and the tank is finally clear! I wonder if maybe the pumps are causing the cloudyness?
- Worried that heater blew because not in surge protecter. Will check temp of tank 14 tomorrow and make sure all of the outlets are working.
