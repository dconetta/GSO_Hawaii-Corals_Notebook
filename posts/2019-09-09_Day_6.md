- Today used the squeegees to clean the glass walls of the tanks  
- Plug #2070 fully died in tank 14  
- PAR sensor did say error to start and I took measurements during the time the tank was refilling  
- P acuta corals don’t look good especially Tank 12  
    - Very few live spots and covered in algae  
    - Tank 11 looks better but not by much
