- Temperature probe and PAR sensor were back in play today!  -
- Today we treated reservoir with Sodium Thiosulfate and did a 5 Gallon water changeWater was about ½°C cooler than usual so we changed all the heaters (the small ones that max at 25°C  to the larger ones that go up to 32°C).  
- We also clipped the the bottom off of the coral on plug 2304 and put it back onto the same plug
