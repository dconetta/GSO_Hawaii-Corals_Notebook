- Today I drained the reservoir of Bleach and Sodium Thiosulfate treated effluent  
- Once drained I put two gallons of bleach in the reservoir and blocked the outflow so I could still start cleaning the tanks  
- I wiped down all the glass for Tanks 14, 12, and 11.  
- For the rack that was in Tank 13 I soaked the PVC stand in ~10% bleach while cleaning the other tank.  
    - Rinse and brushed the PVC stand and grate in fresh water with toothbrush before re-assembling and putting the rack back into the tank  
    - Took out temporary rack and cleaned it (the lid top and the grate)  
    - I then drained all of Tank 13 and took out the heater and blower to clean them and let them fully dry  
- Probes are still down so only salinity and PAR measurements taken today.  
- Dead spot to watch – plug 2012 in Tank 14…
