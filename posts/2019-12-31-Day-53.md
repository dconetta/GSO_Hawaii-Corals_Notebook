**Coral status:** Tanks 11 Moderate, Tank 12 Great!, Tank 13 Poor  
**Tank status:** Tanks 11 Moderate, Tank 12 Moderate, Tank 13 Good  
**Reservior status:** 70 gal

**Actions**  
- Rerouted pewer to tank 13 using new HP pwer strip and long blue cord from outlet 3 to outlet 1
- Daily measurements
    - Checked pH with fisherbrand strips and Orion Star A221
- Tank maintenance

**Notes**  
- Not sure how accurate either were but pH strips did not seem right pH ~6.5-7. Orion pH ~8.1-8.2. This seems more right but is in old electrode solution and has not been calibrated in several months.
