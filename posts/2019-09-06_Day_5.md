- Today did another water change and check in on the corals  
- MCAP tanks look happy and stable especially after the pruning of dead portions!  
- Algae has started to grow so may need to clean tanks fully on Monday  
    - Not sure about cleaning spat plugs though  
- Did typical 5 Gallon water change and took measurements before then with flushing water lines.
