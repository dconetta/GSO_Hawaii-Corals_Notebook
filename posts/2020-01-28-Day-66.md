**Reservoir status:** 60 gal

**Tank/Coral status:**  
|ID|Tank status|Coral status|
|--|---|---|
|13|Moderate|Poor|
|12|Moderate|Good|
|11|Moderate|Ok|

**Actions**  
- Fed tank 13 corals artemia
- Treated infected tank 11 plugs (1606, 2513) in weak Lugol's solution for 10 min to curb advancement of disease

**Notes**
- Tank 11 frags frags clipped 20200124 (2513, 1606) look as thought disese is spreading but other two plugs in tank 11 look healthy
- It doesn't look like there is any new death in tank 13
- The way I distinguish "new" from "old" death in the corals is that "old death" is covered in algae whereas "new death" typically takes ~1 week to accumulate algae growth
- All tanks have some algae grwoth to be squeegeed
