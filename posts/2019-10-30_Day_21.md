**Coral status:** Good  
**Tank status:** Good, but needs to be squeegeed  
**Reservior status:** 40 gal

**Actions**  
- Checked on corals and reservior.  
- Replaced drippers
- Clipped Mcap frags 2858, 2564, and 1484 and transferrred to new plugs. 
- Photographed all tank 12 corals  
- Clipped Pacu frag 2753; Clipped Pacu frags 1316, 1082, 1353, and 1695 and transferred to new plugs

**Notes**  
- Four of the tank 12 corals were overgrown with algae on the stem of the fragments so I clipped these and transferred them to new plugs
- Water clarity good

Drippers:

- Because flow for the last week has clearly been below 1/2 gal/hour in each tank I tested the flow with new drippers. Flow rate with the new drippers is back at 1/2 gal/hour.  

Clippings:

- Used old plugs (from the blue bucket) because we were out of labelled plugs  
    - Before clipping, I rinsed old plugs well with DI water, wiped with ethanol, and rinsed again with DI water  
- Tank 12 photos were taken before clipping fragments  
- Between fragments rinsed clippers well with DI water, wiped with ethanol, and rinsed again with DI water
