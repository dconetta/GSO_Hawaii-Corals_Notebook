**Reservoir status:** 45 gal

**Actions**  
- Added ~105 mL sodium thiosulfate to tank 14 to neutralize 2% bleach/saltwater solution

**Notes**
- Mcap corals seemed to have eaten most of the brine shrimp provided yesterday. Only a few left on the botton of the tank. They could have also just left with the outflow though
- Plue 1260 in tank 11 staus has worsened
    - Tissue between polups receded on almost whole frag. This is the first time that I've noticed this event in any of the coral frags
- Tank 12 corals are happy and healthy as usual. Yay!
