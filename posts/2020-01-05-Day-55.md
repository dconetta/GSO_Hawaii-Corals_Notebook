**Coral status:** Tanks 11 Ok, Tank 12 Great!, Tank 13 Ok  
**Tank status:** Moderate  
**Reservior status:** 35 gal

**Actions**  
- Fed tank 13 corals brine shrimp
- Daily measurements
- Treateed all tank 11 corals with Lugol's Iodine
- 1 pump in tank 13 replaced due to poor suctioning
    - Old pump disinfected and thoroughly rinsed
- Took 5 gal out of tank 14 and added ~0.75 gal of bleach (~2%)

**Notes**  
- Tank 13 coals are still bleached but seem stable
- Algae growth in tank 13 is now similar to other tanks
- Tank 12 inflow was not on (probably why the reservior was so low)
- Tanks 11 & 12 are cloudly, 11 more so
- Lots of debris to be sucked up from tank 12, but will wait for it to reach noral water level
- Tank 11 corals seem fine after treatment on 12/1
- Plug 1260 in Tank 11 connecting tissue between polyps is receded on 1 branch
